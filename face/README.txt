Please open main.m to run the codes. You will find the implementation of 
all experiments and calls of the functions made. 
Sections are splited by %%. In each section, work space is cleared and 
required dataset is loaded. Please run section by section. First three sections 
performs the subject classification with different datasets. 
But please note datasets are not shuffled. Please 
comment out some lines to try different combinations of classifiers. 
Accuracy will be printed out in the command window. The last two sections 
performs the facial/neutral classification. Test and training datasets are 
shuffled to evaluate the accuracy better.
